**Rating:** 7/10

**Summary:** 

This book outlines why strong fiber connectivity is important for economic and social development and argues that the United States is falling behind in the race to deploy fiber to homes and businesses. Why is fiber important? It can be continuously upgraded without having to lay new wire (it's just a matter of switching out electronics at either end) and thus virtually guarantees that homes and businesses with fiber will be able to take advantage of new internet-based applications. 

Overall, I thought the book helped to shed a light onto a technology we typically think so little about, yet which carries nearly all of the world's information, at least between cities and under oceans. I would have liked more technical discussion, but the economic and social arguments are important for spurring people and governments to action. 

**Quotes:**

"Fiber plus advanced wireless capability is as central to the next phase of human existence as electricity was a hundred years ago. Just as countries that quickly ensured cheap access to electricity revolutionized their economies and provided dramatically improved quality of life for their citizens, countries that figure out how to get fiber to everyone will have ever - increasing advantages over those that do it slowly." 

"The secret to mass electrification was twofold : lower the price of electricity and get more “ appliances ” out to more people by whatever means possible . Electricity became normal and invisible."

"Fiber and wireless are complementary technologies. Saying 'the future is wireless , who cares about fiber' is like saying we can have airplanes without airports — those wireless signals need a wire in order to travel any real distance."

"The goal should be construction of open - access, dark, last - mile fiber available for lease and overseen by a public authority in every part of the country to all (or almost all) homes and businesses. It has to be open access to permit retail competition wherever possible. It has to be overseen by public authorities so that it will serve the public interests in low prices and high - quality services to everyone."
