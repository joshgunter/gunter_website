## Project: Books I have read

This is a minimal website, cloned from [Karl Broman](https://kbroman.org/simple_site), to publicly record the books I've read throughout the year. 

The project is inspired by numerious sources, including: 
* Daniel Hofstetter's Books I have read [site](https://books.danielhofstetter.com/)

Thank you for reading!
